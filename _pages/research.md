## Working Papers

**[The Causal Effect of WIC on Breastfeeding: A Partial Identification Approach with Regression Discontinuity](../files/Anderson_PARTID(June2025).pdf)**  
  - The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend breastfeeding as the preferred method of infant feeding, citing benefits such as reduced maternal risk of diabetes and lower rates of childhood obesity, among other positive health outcomes. Breastfeeding promotion and support is a core service of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves approximately half of all U.S. infants; however, program benefits include quantity vouchers for infant formula, encouraging substitution away from breastfeeding among participating mothers. Leveraging the program's income eligibility threshold, we combine partial-identification assumptions with a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to identify the local average treatment effect (LATE) on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding. Using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), we find that participation in WIC reduces the probability of initiating breastfeeding by at least \(3\%\) and the duration of breastfeeding by at least \(2\) weeks.  

**[Intensive Margin Welfare Implications: Evidence from WIC EBT](../files/Anderson_WICEBT(June2025).pdf)**  
  - Participation frictions may operate equally on both the extensive and intensive margin. Using administrative data from the WIC program, we identify the effect of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) on extensive margin program participation, intensive margin utilization of benefits, and program administrative costs. We find that the adoption of EBT reduces the average monthly redemption of food benefits and does not affect program participation, administrative costs, or food security. Under theoretically and empirically motivated assumptions, we show that the intensive margin effects from EBT are welfare increasing, highlighting the importance of intensive margin participation in the evaluation of in-kind transfer programs. 

## Works in Progress

**Targeting with Quality Differentiated In-Kind Transfers: Evidence from WIC**  
  - The in-kind provision of public benefits restricts recipient choice but potentially enhances targeting. We extend the approach of Lieber and Lockwood (2019) to analyze this tradeoff when transferred benefits differ in quality from available alternatives, introducing indirect costs. We use this framework to study the in-kind transfer of infant formula by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves approximately half of U.S. infants. Using the 2009 WIC Food Package Revision as an instrumental variable, we find that each additional week of exclusive breastfeeding significantly reduces childhood obesity risk and improves growth trajectories through age five. Although the in-kind provision of formula effectively targets a subset of eligible participants with potentially higher marginal utility, the quality differential between formula and breastfeeding generates substantial indirect healthcare costs. Under standard modeling assumptions, these indirect costs significantly reduce the optimal formula subsidy rate.
