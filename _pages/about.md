I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia and will be on the job market in the 2025–2026 academic year. My research focuses public and health economics, with a particular focus on the design and impact of U.S. nutrition assistance programs.

My work applies partial identification methods to address challenges in causal inference for program evaluation. In particular, I extend standard approaches—such as regression discontinuity designs—by incorporating partial identification techniques that relax conventional identifying assumptions while preserving credible estimation.
