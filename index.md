I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia and will be on the job market in the 2025â€“2026 academic year. My research centers on public economics and applied econometrics, with a focus on the design and impact of U.S. nutrition assistance programs.

My work develops econometric and welfare frameworks that address fundamental challenges in public program evaluation and are broadly applicable across settings. Methodologically, I extend regression discontinuity designs to accommodate mismeasured assignment variables and ambiguous treatment classification, using partial identification to relax conventional assumptions while retaining credible estimation. With respect to welfare analysis, I develop new models of in-kind provision that incorporate procurement rebates and reduced product quality, mechanisms that matter not only to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) but also for the evaluation of public assistance programs more broadly.
