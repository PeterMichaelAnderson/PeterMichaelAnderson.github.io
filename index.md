I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia and will be on the job market in the 2025–2026 academic year. My research focuses on public economics and applied econometrics, with a particular emphasis on the design and impact of U.S. nutrition assistance programs such as WIC

My work applies partial identification methods to address challenges in causal inference for program evaluation. In particular, I extend standard approaches—such as regression discontinuity designs—by incorporating partial identification techniques that relax conventional identifying assumptions while preserving credible estimation.
